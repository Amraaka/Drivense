## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Road accidents are a major cause of death and injury in Mongolia, often caused by driver distraction, fatigue, and negligence.  
Most existing safety measures focus on **post-accident response** rather than **real-time prevention**.  
**DRIVENSE** closes this gap by instantly detecting unsafe behaviors and alerting the driver before itâ€™s too late.

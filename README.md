# ðŸš— Driver Fatigue Monitoring App

This is a simple Flutter MVP app that helps drivers stay safe on the road by detecting signs of fatigue and risky driving behavior.  

**Main features:**
- Uses the phoneâ€™s front camera and sensors to detect signs of tiredness (like yawning or long driving hours)
- Sends voice or vibration alerts to warn the driver
- Stores driving stats in a backend for basic daily/weekly reports

**Why this app?**  
Many accidents happen because drivers get too tired or distracted. This app is a small step to help reduce that risk by giving timely alerts and encouraging breaks.

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter & Dart** for the mobile app
- **Google ML Kit** for on-device face and fatigue detection
